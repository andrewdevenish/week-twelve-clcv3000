Last week I was so busy with my other classes and having to finish and hand in all my final assignments so I went back and did the exercises this week instead. For the creativity exercise I used Stepworks. My creative attempt was incredibly small in scale because I genuinely have no talent or ability for telling stories like this, and no creativity to leverage either – this exercise did not play to my strengths. It takes the format of a text conversation between two students discussing their experience on the graveyard project. The dialogue is not very enthralling, but I can imagine how powerful the medium could be in the hands of someone who does have the ability to write compelling dialogue. Here is the stage I used for my little ‘story’ told in text messages:

Although my engagement and ability with creative endeavors is limited, tools like Stepworks could easily be used to tell compelling stories about archaeology. AS Sara Perry says, the field of archaeology contains an incredible amount of people, stories, characters, and compelling and interesting artefacts and sites (Perry, Sara. 2019. The Enchantment of the Archaeological Record. European Journal of Archaeology. 22.3, 354). Even though I myself was caught by writer’s block and unable to come up with anything engaging, it is plain to see how creative tools can be used to tell fascinating stories about archaeology and communicate data to people in an interesting way.

With this third module, I found myself understanding the material I was reading and doing far easier to understand the second module, in which I had problems just understanding the complex readings I was doing. My ‘win’ for this module, then, is that I was able to connect in my head the ideas between the readings and the exercises. Everything made sense to me and I was able to follow along each week without ever being confused. That may seem normal but after last module, it felt like a win to me.

My ‘fail’ for this module was the fact that I was unable to do the work properly in the week I was supposed to. Earlier in the semester, I struggled to keep up in the first module because I did not adjust to university life and online work fast enough after the summer. I learned from that fail in Module 1 and for the rest of the semester was able to keep up with the work. Except for last week. I do not have many exams this semester so instead I had a large essay due for every single class last week, and that resulted in me not being able to give time to this class. SO my ‘fail’ is that I thought I learned how to manage time better back in Module 1 but last week showed me where I could improve even more.

The most challenging thing for me this module was the creative exercises. As I mentioned earlier, I am not creative. I have always struggled to perform in creative situations. I am good at writing essays, but I am very bad at writing stories. A lot of time was spent sitting in front of my computer trying to think of something, anything, to put into something creative for the graveyard assignment and the only thing that I could do was the short Stepworks creation linked above. I did not find the steps to create in Stepworks too hard and I was able to get the technology working quite easily – all of my difficulty came from my problems with creativity itself, and it was definitely the most challenging thing this module, and in fact the entire semester.

Overall, I found this module more interesting and more engaging than the second module. I especially enjoyed the ‘sharing authority’ exercise from Week 10, as I felt an extremely strong connection between what I was doing in that exercise with the themes of the week, and it was enjoyable on its own as a bonus. Communicating digital archaeology can be done in a hugely varied amount of ways, as this module explored, and I found exercises like that one which directly engage someone in doing fun, interesting work a really good way to do digital archaeology.

Throughout this course, my thinking changed a lot in the past 12 weeks. I started the course b y having difficulties just wrapping my head around what I was doing. I did not know what digital archaeology was, I had never engaged with archaeology outside watching some basic historical documentaries where they occasionally show archaeological dig sites. What I have earned is that the field is incredibly broad, and varied, and that the world of digital archaeology is filled with tools, technology, and techniques to ‘do’ digital archaeology, as well as perform outreach and communicate it to people in the form of stories and other creative endeavours. My thinking shifted from just wondering what on earth it was, to now primarily having a great respect for the vast amount of things digital archaeologists can do and the kind of research and data collection that is being done. The field is much more data-driven than my initial ideas about the course led me to believe, as well. This course has been very different from any other I have ever taken, and it has taught me a lot of valuable lessons that I can take into history classes in the future.




Overall for module 3, I would give myself a grade of C or C+, with my breakdown by learning outcome below.

Analytical Ability - C
Methodology – C+
Collaboration - C
Argumentation - B
Professionalization - A
